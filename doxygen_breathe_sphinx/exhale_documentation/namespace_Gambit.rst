Detailed Description
--------------------

Simulation of "Search for photonic signatures of gauge-mediated supersymmetry in 13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector".

Anders Kvellestad 

2020 June




Based on:

Known issues:

1) Photon isolation requirement is missing 2) They use a bizarre HT definition where they don't apply overlap removal between photons and jets. This might not work for us, since jets won't be made by photons in our events.
