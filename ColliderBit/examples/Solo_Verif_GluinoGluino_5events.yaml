# Simple example input file for running CBS
# Pat Scott May 2019

#TP 19th Jul 2019 - just fiddled slightly with the original to take a hepmc file from
#the ATLAS_0Lep analysis (generated in PYTHIA) which we are using to verify CBS.
#Settings adjusted accordingly.

#EDIT TP Jul 22nd - using input from GAMBIT to esnure consistency.
