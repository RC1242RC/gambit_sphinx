Quick guide:

  1. Construct a configuration file and place it in the directory 'configs', e.g., configs/example.py. 


  2. Run cbgb.py with the configuration file as input argument:
     
       python cbgb.py configs/example.py


  3. The generated code needed for GAMBIT is stored in the following output files: 

       frontend_header_code.hpp
       backend_types_header_code.hpp
     
     Copy the code in frontend_header_code.hpp to the correct frontend header file in GAMBIT,
     e.g., Backends/include/gambit/Backends/frontends/mybackend_1_0.hpp

     Copy the code in backend_types_header_code.hpp to the correct backend types header file in GAMBIT,
     e.g., Backends/include/gambit/Backends/backend_types/mybackend_1_0.hpp
